Installation
============

Installing LimeSurvey is easy: Unpack LimeSurvey into a folder 
on your webserver. Open the installer with your webbrowser:

http://localhost/limesurvey/index.php/installer

You will be guided step by step through the installation.


Common Pitfalls
===============

* If opening the installer address results in a 404 error message 
looking different to your server 404 messages, ensure you don't
have any special characters like spaces in your installation 
path.

* The previous button is not always helpful as some of your already
entered data might get lost and you need to enter it again.
